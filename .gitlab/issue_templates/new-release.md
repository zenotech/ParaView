      - [ ] Upload to www.paraview.org/files/v@MAJOR@.@MINOR@
    - Catalyst Guide
      - [ ] Rename to ParaViewCatalystGuide-@VERSION@.pdf
      - [ ] Upload to www.paraview.org/files/v@MAJOR@.@MINOR@
    - Getting Started Guide
      - [ ] Rename to ParaViewGettingStarted-@VERSION@.pdf
      - [ ] Upload to www.paraview.org/files/v@MAJOR@.@MINOR@
    - macOS sigining machine
      - [ ] if the machine is offline, request to be switched on.

# Update ParaView

  - Update the local copy of `@BASEBRANCH@`.
    - If `@PATCH@@RC@` is `0-RC1`, update `master`
    - Otherwise, update `release`
      ```
      git fetch origin
      git checkout @BASEBRANCH@
      git merge --ff-only origin/@BASEBRANCH@ # if this fails, there are local commits that need to be removed
      git submodule update --recursive --init
      ```
    - If `@BASEBRANCH@` is not `master`, ensure merge requests which should be
      in the release have been merged. The [`backport-mrs.py`][backport-mrs]
      script can be used to find and ensure that merge requests assigned to the
      associated milestone are available on the `release` branch.

  - Integrate changes.
    - Make a commit for each of these `release`-only changes on a single topic
      (suggested branch name: `update-to-v@VERSION@`):
      - Assemble release notes into `Documentation/release/ParaView-@VERSION@.md`.
        - [ ] If `PATCH` is greater than 0, add items to the end of this file.
      - [ ] Update `version.txt` and tag the commit (tag this commit below)
        ```
        git checkout -b update-to-v@VERSION@@RC@ @BRANCHPOINT@
        echo @VERSION@@RC@ > version.txt
        git commit -m 'Update version number to @VERSION@@RC@' version.txt
        ```
      - [ ] Update VTK's `paraview/release` branch. The
            [`release-mr`][release-mr]  script should be used to do this. Pass
            `-c .kitware-release-paraview.json` to use the appropriate
            configuration file.
        - [ ] Merge the VTK `paraview/release` update MR
        - [ ] Update kwrobot with the new `paraview/release` branch rules (@ben.boeckel)
      - [ ] `.gitmodules` to track the `paraview/release` branch of VTK
      - [ ] Update `.gitlab/ci/cdash-groups.json` to track the `release` CDash
            groups

    - Create a merge request targeting `release`
      - [ ] Obtain a GitLab API token for the `kwrobot.release.paraview` user
            (ask @ben.boeckel if you do not have one)
      - [ ] Add the `kwrobot.release.paraview` user to your fork with at least
            `Developer` privileges (so it can open MRs)
      - [ ] Use [the `release-mr`][release-mr] script to open the create the
            Merge Request (see script for usage)
        - Pull the script for each release; it may have been updated since it
          was last used
        - `release-mr.py -t TOKEN_STRING -c .kitware-release.json -m @BRANCHPOINT@`
        - The script outputs the information it will be using to create the
          merge request. Please verify that it is all correct before creating
          the merge request. See usage at the top of the script to provide
          information that is either missing or incorrect (e.g., if its data
          extraction heuristics fail).
    - [ ] Get positive review
    - [ ] `Do: merge`
    - [ ] Create tag: `git tag -a -m '@VERSION@@RC@' @VERSION@@RC@ commit-that-updated-version.txt`
  - Create tarballs
    - [ ] ParaView (`Utilities/Maintenance/create_tarballs.bash --txz --tgz --zip -v v@VERSION@@RC@`)
  - Upload tarballs to `paraview.org`
    - [ ] Setup your `~/.ssh/config` and add the web host (@vbolea).
    - [ ] `rsync -rptv $tarballs web:ParaView_Release/v@MAJOR@.@MINOR@/`
  - Software process updates (these can all be done independently)
    - [ ] Update kwrobot with the new `release` branch rules (@ben.boeckel)
    - [ ] Run [this script][cdash-update-groups] to update the CDash groups
      - This must be done after a nightly run to ensure all builds are in the
        `release` group
      - See the script itself for usage documentation
    - [ ] Add (or update if `@BASEBRANCH@` is `release`) version selection entry
          in paraview-superbuild
